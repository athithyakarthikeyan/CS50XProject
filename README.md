## Description
This Python Wordle game, conceived as the culminating project for HarvardX CS50, delivers an immersive and interactive user experience. Crafted by Athithya Karthikeyan, the game challenges players to deduce a 5-letter word in six attempts, using dynamic text output and color-coded tiles. Beyond testing players' word-guessing skills, the game integrates educational elements by ensuring guessed words are valid singular nouns, leveraging a dictionary API for validation. This project showcases programming expertise, creative design, and a commitment to enhancing users' linguistic knowledge within an engaging and stimulating gaming framework.

## Requirements
To ensure the proper functioning of the Wordle Python program on other machines, the following requirements must be met. It is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:


These dependencies include:

- **requests:** Used for making HTTP requests to the dictionary API.
- **rich:** Enables rich text formatting for an enhanced user interface.
- **stopwatch:** Manages the timing functionality for tracking the duration of the game.

To install these dependencies, users can run the following command in their terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I would like to thank Harvard University for providing a wonderful program and an exceptional experience. Special thanks to Dr. David J. Malan for his eloquent teaching and guidance throughout the course.
