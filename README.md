Project Title : Wordle

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/UBmaR-zDPDI

Description: This Python Wordle game, conceived as the culminating project for HarvardX CS50, delivers an immersive and interactive user experience. Crafted by Athithya Karthikeyan, the game tasks participants with deducing a 5-letter word in six attempts, employing dynamic text output featuring color-coded tiles. Beyond testing players' word-guessing acumen, the game integrates educational components by ensuring that guessed words adhere to common singular nouns, utilizing a dictionary API for validation. The project serves as a showcase of adept programming skills, imaginative design, and a dedication to enriching users' linguistic knowledge within an enjoyable and stimulating gaming framework.
