## Description
Wordle game made using Python. This project was a requirement for the CS50X online course conducted by Harvard University.

## Requirements
To ensure the proper functioning of the Wordle Python program on other machines, the following requirements must be met. It is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

requests==2.26.0 
rich==10.9.0 
stopwatch==0.3.0

These dependencies include:

- **requests:** Used for making HTTP requests to the dictionary API.
- **rich:** Enables rich text formatting for an enhanced user interface.
- **stopwatch:** Manages the timing functionality for tracking the duration of the game.

To install these dependencies, users can run the following command in their terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I would like to thank Harvard University for providing a wonderful program and an exceptional experience. Special thanks to Dr. David J. Malan for his eloquent teaching and guidance throughout the course.
